# HTTP Server for a guide of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

### How to use

The server can run using any python interpreter, for example using the shell command
```bash
python <path>/zelda_guide_server.py
```
where path is the logical path where the file is in the server. When started, it's possible to
use any browser as a client and insert to the URL bar the link to http://localhost:8080 with
an eventual resource (for example http://localhost:8080/favicon.ico), otherwise it will
automatically redirect to the **index.html page**.
